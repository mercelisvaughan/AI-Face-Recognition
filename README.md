"# AI-Face-Recognition" 

This application implements the AWS facial rekognition API, to use this application you will pull the code and just run it.
The images attached are the only pictures to be tested, to add more drag and drop any .jpg files and change the name under the "person", "animal", or "imageWithText" variables. My credentials are being used so the code should run! Thanks!
